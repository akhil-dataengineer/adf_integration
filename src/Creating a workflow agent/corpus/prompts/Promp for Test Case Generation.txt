-- Below Prompt was used in Microsoft copilot

please use the attached test case template 'Test_Case_Template' as an reference and use the below information and create a good test cases document with proper details and presentable information test case document based on the below 2 scenarios
secanario 1
1. Emplifi profile dataset having 2000 rows loaded in to databricks DBFS file system.
2. Vs code with github copilot reads the dataset from dbfs 
3. With proper prompt githubcopilot starts creating the python code and the python code is synced with databricks
4. ADLS is mounted with databricks
5. github produces code to create medalion arcitecture to create gold, silver and bronze folder in ADLS
6. Bronze will have straight copy of Emplifi data as parquet file
7. Silver will have non null columns and it will be parquet file
8. Synapase will be mounted to ADLS and it can read data from silver, bronze layer
9. Create external table in synapse based on parquet file and store in a database with schema .
10. Use power Bi desktop to create a dashboard based on the table using microsoft copilot
11. And publish the app in synapse 

scenario 2
1. 'Semrush' data is pulled through API using Githubcopilot in VS code
2. Template is created for ADF piplines using githubcopilot
3.With proper prompt githubcopilot starts creating the python code and the python code is synced with databricks
3. githubcopilot also creates a json file for ADF
4. ADF piplines are created with promting using a JSON 
5. ADLS is mounted with databricks
6. ADF pipline cretes a folder inside ADLS container and creats parquet file
7. ADF pipline also creates tables in microsoft sqlserver 
8. Most of the steps were done through prompting in vs code using githubcopliot.
