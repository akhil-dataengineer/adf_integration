Prompt 1: 

"Create a professional cloud architecture diagram with the following structure:
--Three main sections laid out left to right:
----Available Data Sources (Left)
------Box labeled “Available Data Sources”
------Containing items: Emplifi, Voltron, Pangea, Bluesky, Blubrry, Threads, Adobe

----AI-Powered Azure Platform (Center)
------Title: “AI-Powered Azure Platform”
------Four stacked service boxes inside:
--------Azure Data Factory
----------Note: AI-generated pipelines
--------Data Lake Gen2 + GitHub Copilot
----------Notes: Bronze/Silver/Gold layers, AI-optimized partitioning
--------Databricks + GitHub Copilot
----------Notes: AI-assisted PySpark code, Schema handling, Error recovery
--------Synapse + AI Copilots
----------Notes: AI-generated DDL scripts, Optimized queries

----Intelligent Consumption (Right)
------Box labeled “Power BI + MS Copilot”
------Notes: AI-generated DAX formulas, Natural language to visuals, Auto insights

----Arrows / Flow:
------Data flows from Data Sources → Azure Data Factory → Data Lake → Databricks → Synapse → Power BI.
------Use clean directional arrows to show the flow.

----Style:
------Mix of Azure corporate style (clean rectangles, Azure blue palette) and modern infographic style (colorful highlights, light gradients).
------Each service box should have a bold title, small descriptive bullets, and icons if available (Azure Data Factory, ADLS, Databricks, Synapse, Power BI).
------Background should be light and professional, suitable for presentation slides."

Prompt 2: 

"Quick improvements to make it more professional and executive-ready:
--Section Headers
----Put a light background band behind each section (Data Sources | AI-Powered Azure Platform | Intelligent Consumption) so it’s visually grouped.

--Service Highlights
----Add 2–3 bullets under each service icon (like you had earlier: e.g., ADF → AI-generated pipelines).
----Keeps the detail but still neat.

--Consistency of Icons
----Replace the SQL icon at the end with the official Power BI icon (yellow bar chart) since that’s more recognizable than generic SQL.

--Flow Arrows
----Use thicker arrows with labels (e.g., Pipelines, Clean Data, Optimized Queries) instead of plain connectors.

--Color Balance
----Right now icons are mixed (blue, red, etc.). Apply a consistent Azure palette (mostly blues + Power BI yellow as a pop).

--Title & Subtitle
----Add a clear title on top: USAGM AI-Powered Azure Data Platform
------Subtitle: End-to-End AI-Enhanced Development Lifecycle."
