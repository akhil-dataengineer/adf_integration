Prompt 1: "Use the requirements specifications document attached, review and analyze it thoroughly. Then, generate a professional, impressive design document for our 
		   data engg. project."

Prompt 2: "The goal is to complete this fully in the next 8 days or so. 
		   Also, not always do we have raw data stored in the broze layer. In some cases in the USAGM project, we have raw data being pulled from the API 
		   (in a Databricks env) followed by processing, transforming and storing the resulting data in a Bronze/Silver layer in ADLS. This data is then 
		   exported to Azure Synapse by the use of pipelines in Azure Data Factory.
		   So, considering the above points, generate a better, even more impressive professional design document."


Prompt 3: "Consider the following feedback and re-generate a refined, more prefessional and impressive design doc: 
		   1. We do need the use of a Dynamic Storage Router. 
		   2. No code in the doc."
