Generate a transcript (refer to the attached files as templates) such that: 
	imagine my company, Icube Consultancy Services Inc. (team could be data engineers or leads etc.) is at the client location right now to learn from the cleint about the 
	requirements of the project, ask questions/doubts to understand better, talk about the resources they have eg. the data engineers etc.
	
	Also, think about what more conversations would normally happen, what more questions might be asked, what gaps might be highlighted, what feasibility aspects will be discussed, 
	what roles and responsibilities will be talked about and much more. 
			
	Based on this, generate a realistic transcript like how a real requirements gathering interaction with a client would happen.
