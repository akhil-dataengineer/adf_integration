Transcript – First Client–Consultant Meeting (Azure Data Engineering Project)

Participants

Client: Sarah (Head of Analytics, RetailCorp)

Consultant: Raj (Senior Data Engineering Consultant, TechSolutions)

Opening

Raj (Consultant): Thanks for meeting today, Sarah. Since this is our first discussion, my goal is to understand your current ecosystem, pain points, and what you want to achieve. Then I can suggest how Azure data engineering tools might fit.

Sarah (Client): Great. We know we need to modernize our reporting, but we’re not clear on how.

Business Drivers

Raj: Let’s start with the business side. What are the top three reasons this initiative is happening now?

Sarah:

Leadership wants faster access to metrics like sales vs. marketing spend.

Current reporting is manual and error-prone.

We expect data volumes to double in the next 2–3 years with e-commerce growth.

Raj: So speed, accuracy, and scalability are the drivers. Understood.

Current State

Raj: Where is your data currently stored?

Sarah: Sales and inventory live in SQL Server (~2TB). Marketing data comes from APIs like Facebook and Google Ads. Analysts pull CSVs into Power BI, but there’s no central warehouse.

Raj: And no automated pipelines yet?

Sarah: None—everything outside SQL is manual.

Gaps & Risks

Raj: From what you’re describing, I see a few gaps:

No central data lake/warehouse → no single source of truth.

Manual ingestion → delays and risk of human error.

No data governance layer → no rules for schema validation, data quality, lineage.

Scalability → current methods won’t handle doubling volumes.

Would you agree?

Sarah: Absolutely. Especially governance—we’ve had numbers that don’t match across departments.

Feasibility Clarifications

Raj: You mentioned “real-time.” For clarity, do you mean sub-second streaming or near-real-time (say, hourly)?

Sarah: Hourly refresh would be fine.

Raj: That’s much more feasible. True streaming requires Azure Event Hubs or Kafka, but hourly can be handled easily with Azure Data Factory triggers or Databricks jobs.

Azure-Oriented Strategy

Raj: Based on Azure tools, a high-level approach could be:

Ingestion:

Azure Data Factory (ADF) for orchestrating pipelines from SQL Server and APIs.

REST API connectors for marketing platforms.

Storage:

Azure Data Lake Gen2 (ADLS) as the landing zone.

Adopt Medallion Architecture: Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), Gold (curated).

Processing:

Databricks with PySpark for scalable transformations.

Optionally Azure Functions for lightweight API calls.

Modeling & Serving:

Synapse Analytics for curated data models.

Power BI connected to Synapse for reporting.

Governance & Monitoring:

Delta Lake with schema enforcement.

Data quality checks with Great Expectations or custom PySpark checks.

Azure Monitor + Log Analytics for pipeline observability.

Sarah: That makes sense. But how would we enforce data quality?

Raj: For example, if campaign spend comes in negative or a required field is null, Databricks jobs can flag it. ADF can fail gracefully with retry logic. We can also add email/SMS alerts through Azure Monitor.

Cost & Resource Concerns

Sarah: Databricks always worries leadership—costs can spiral.

Raj: That’s a fair concern. To manage costs:

Use auto-scaling clusters that shut down when idle.

Schedule heavy transformations during off-peak hours.

Store raw data cheaply in ADLS (very cost-efficient).

Push light aggregations into Synapse serverless pools for quick queries.

We’ll also set up cost monitoring dashboards in Azure to show cluster usage.

Strategic Alignment

Raj: One more question: do you see advanced analytics or machine learning in your roadmap?

Sarah: Yes, probably in the next 1–2 years.

Raj: Perfect. If we design the pipelines in Databricks with the medallion approach, it’ll be easy to plug ML models into the Gold layer later on.

Wrap-Up

Raj: To summarize:

Current issues = manual work, no single source of truth, governance gaps.

Immediate goal = automated pipelines, hourly refresh, trusted dashboards.

Recommended Azure stack = ADF + ADLS + Databricks + Synapse + Power BI.

Risks = schema changes, governance, cost management.

Next step = I’ll prepare a discovery summary and high-level architecture diagram for validation.

Sarah: Excellent. That gives us a clear starting point. Looking forward to your proposal.
